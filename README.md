## Description
WolfLib  is a Windows API function discovery library that allows you to hide your usage of Windows API functions. It provides advanced techniques to obfuscate your code, making it difficult for reverse engineers to detect and analyze your function invocations.

## Features
- Hidden Function Address Discovery: WolfLib uses intelligent algorithms to dynamically discover function addresses, hiding your direct usage of Windows API functions.
- Runtime Function Resolution: Resolve function addresses at runtime for optimal performance and compatibility.
- Comprehensive Function Abstraction: Interact with Windows API functions without exposing their names explicitly, enhancing the security of your application.
- Lightweight and Easy Integration: Seamless integration into new or existing projects with minimal overhead and efficient execution.
- Documentation and Examples: Documentation and examples to guide you through the implementation and usage of WolfLib.
- Community and Support: Engage with a vibrant community of developers, share insights, report issues, and contribute to ongoing development.
